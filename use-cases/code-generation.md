# Use Case: Code Generation Assistant

## 📌 Business Description
Software development teams use LLM-based tools to assist with writing boilerplate code, generating functions, refactoring legacy systems, or explaining unfamiliar codebases.

## ⚙️ LLM Functionality
- Code suggestion and completion
- Syntax generation
- Code explanation
- Comment generation

## 🔍 Risk Mapping
| Risk Category             | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Insecure Output Handling | Generated code may contain vulnerabilities or bad practices                |
| Model Theft              | Proprietary code patterns may be unintentionally replicated                |
| Overreliance             | Developers may stop reviewing LLM-generated code for correctness           |
| Sensitive Info Leakage   | Suggestions may include fragments of training data or user-entered secrets |

## 🧩 Framework Alignment
### NIST AI RMF
- **Map:** Define developer roles and where code gen is used in the pipeline
- **Measure:** Evaluate accuracy, bug rate, and security flaws in generated code
- **Manage:** Enforce review cycles and implement linting + testing for outputs
- **Govern:** Document policy around use of LLMs in CI/CD and internal toolchains

### OWASP LLM Risks
- LLM02: Insecure Output Handling  
- LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure  
- LLM09: Overreliance  
- LLM10: Model Theft

## 🛡 Mitigation Strategies
- Require human review of all generated code
- Run outputs through static analysis and vulnerability scanners
- Disable memory or history logging when working with proprietary code
- Train developers to use secure prompting practices

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- Maintain audit logs of all generated code snippets
- Mask confidential project details during LLM interactions
- Validate LLM integration complies with internal software security standards
