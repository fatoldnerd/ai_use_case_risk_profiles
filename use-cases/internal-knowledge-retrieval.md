# Use Case: Internal Knowledge Retrieval Bot

## 📌 Business Description
Organizations deploy LLM-powered bots to help employees retrieve answers from internal documentation, wikis, policies, or historical conversations. These bots act as a productivity booster, enabling faster onboarding and reducing reliance on tribal knowledge.

## ⚙️ LLM Functionality
- Semantic search and retrieval
- Contextual summarization
- Natural language Q&A
- Document parsing and chunking

## 🔍 Risk Mapping
| Risk Category             | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hallucination            | LLM may fabricate answers or present outdated/misleading information       |
| Sensitive Info Disclosure| Confidential data may be surfaced to unauthorized users                    |
| Prompt Injection         | Malicious queries may trigger incorrect or harmful behavior                |
| Insecure Retrieval       | Data sources may be improperly scoped or indexed                           |

## 🧩 Framework Alignment
### NIST AI RMF
- **Map:** Define which teams are using the bot and what knowledge sources are integrated
- **Measure:** Track query accuracy, hallucination frequency, and false positive/negative rates
- **Manage:** Apply retrieval access controls, implement escalation or fallback workflows
- **Govern:** Define acceptable use, audit logs, and ownership of training/inference pipelines

### OWASP LLM Risks
- LLM01: Prompt Injection  
- LLM02: Insecure Output Handling  
- LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure  
- LLM09: Overreliance

## 🛡 Mitigation Strategies
- Use RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) with authenticated and versioned sources
- Limit scope of documents accessible to the LLM based on user role
- Implement real-time feedback and escalation options for unclear answers
- Sanitize prompts and redact sensitive fields prior to inference

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- Role-based access to source documents
- Full audit trail of queries and retrieved content
- Document classification integrated into indexing strategy
