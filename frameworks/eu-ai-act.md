# EU AI Act â€“ Reference Guide

This file provides an overview of the **European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act)**â€”a landmark regulatory framework that classifies AI systems by risk and sets compliance obligations across use categories.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
The EU AI Act establishes legal requirements for AI systems operating within the EU, based on a **risk-tiered approach**:
- **Unacceptable Risk** â€“ Banned (e.g., manipulative systems, social scoring)
- **High Risk** â€“ Subject to strict obligations (e.g., biometric ID, employment AI)
- **Limited Risk** â€“ Transparency requirements (e.g., chatbots)
- **Minimal Risk** â€“ No obligations (e.g., spam filters)

The regulation impacts providers, deployers, importers, and distributors of AI systems.

## ðŸ§© Relevance to LLM Use Cases
| Risk Tier       | Example LLM Applications                  | Compliance Focus |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **High Risk**   | AI in recruitment, credit scoring          | Conformity assessments, logging, human oversight |
| **Limited Risk**| Customer-facing LLM chatbots               | User disclosure, transparency of AI nature       |
| **Minimal Risk**| Internal tools like email summarization    | None beyond voluntary codes                      |
