## 📘 Overview
ISO/IEC 42001 helps organizations manage risks and responsibilities associated with the development and use of AI. It applies to any organization deploying AI and focuses on:
- AI-specific organizational governance
- Transparency and accountability
- Lifecycle oversight of AI systems
- Risk-based decision-making
- Stakeholder engagement

It is structured similarly to ISO 27001 (information security), using a Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) management system model.
