# AI Use Case Risk Profiles

Welcome to the **AI Use Case Risk Profiles** repository.

This project provides a structured, easy-to-understand mapping of real-world enterprise LLM use cases to relevant risks, mitigations, and governance frameworks such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications.

> **Goal:** Help enterprises, risk teams, and security-conscious leaders better understand the practical implications of deploying LLMs in various workflows.
